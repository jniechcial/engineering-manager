It may be common among engineers to hear that the company is growing too fast. You may be familiar with such opinions. “All the leaders are talking about is growth”. “It is not the same old company as it was anymore”. Due to growth, “we will become a massive corporation that nobody wants to be”.

The truth is that growth changes companies and everyone should accept that. One day you will come to the office and find out that there are more people that you don’t know than one that you know. It means that the processes that were excellent, maybe even designed by you, are becoming unbearable. It means that your ideas - which used to come up in the morning, be discussed in the afternoon and implemented in the evening - will be discussed for days or weeks and may eventually just be killed due to other priorities. And most of all, it very often means that there is much more job to be done than people available.

Growth sounds like a very bad thing. Like the cold shower that puts you out of the comfort zone and where the only one who benefits is the cofounder with his or her huge stake in the company. Are you, as an engineer, a loser in this game?

Growth also means that a lot of opportunities will appear. There will be hard scaling problems to solve on your production. There will be a place for dedicated security officers. There will be more money around, which means better equipment and high-end tools. Most of the processes will need to be redesigned which is a great place for creative people. There will be a need for experienced executives that will apply for the job and guide you with these problems. Your skills will become much more valuable. You will be able to build your career in the same company without waiting for the current person on your dream position to leave the job.

**Growing is a journey out of the comfort zone. That’s true. But the growth of the company is your growth.**
