### Are you an engineering manager? 👩‍💻
It’s hard to be a good engineering manager. We often struggle to accept what moving from senior engineering positions to management means. A switch from being an experienced domain leader to almost a junior position and a saparate career. We need to share our experienecs to grow as the domain same as software did in last years thanks to open source.

### Are you wondering why management is important? 🤔
People are the key factor in the success of your business. You attract, hire and grow engineers in your company. But on average, engineers change jobs every two years. Direct, honest and great management is the most important way to increase the retntion. People leave managers, not companies.
